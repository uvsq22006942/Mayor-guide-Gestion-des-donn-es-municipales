To install PHP Donation Script on your website, you just need
to unzip PHPDonationScript.zip and copy the files to your preferred folder.

The administration panel will be available on - 

[your installation folder]/admin 

and the default username and password will be -

username: administrator
password: abc123

(after you log in, you can change them with different ones you may prefer)

So for example if you upload it on:

www.yourdomain.com/test

then the administration panel will be available on:

www.yourdomain.com/test/admin
username: administrator
password: abc123

Please note that you are required to keep the Powered By link at the bottom of the site.
If you prefer The Powered By link to be removed, this can be done for $39 one-time fee (we can also do a free installation on your server / hosting package in such case).
