Initially, the purpose of the website is to make taking information about people in a specific town easier and get all the information of this person and his family especially that it is known how hard it is to take the information of a person's family from the big records -which is a big book containing every single information about this person only- that is not well arranged, so searching for a person's family will cost at least 10 to 20 minutes. The structure of this Mayor guide is very simple and easy to use and understand and the tasks are very clearly shown in the main page and the sub-pages and this is the main propriety of a good and well organized website which is presented in our website very clearly.
